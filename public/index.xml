      <description>Deep neural networks (DNNs) typically require massive data to train on, which is a hurdle for numerous practical domains. Facing the data shortfall, one viable option is to acquire domains-specific training data from external uncensored sources, such as the open web or the third-party data collectors. However, the quality of such acquired data is often not rigorously scrutinized, and one cannot easily rule out the risk of &amp;ldquo;poisoned&amp;rdquo; examples being included in such unreliable datasets, resulting in unreliable models which pose potential risks to many data-hungry, or high-stake applications.</description>
