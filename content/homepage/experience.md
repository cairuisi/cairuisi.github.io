      - Found that clean image features and trigger features are different in terms of their activation distribution in channels, as well as their sensitivity to channel re-ordering. 
      
      - Proposed an effective approach with minimal overhead based on channel shuffling to help users detect backdoor attacks without the access to clean samples, nor the need to retrain models.

      - Formulated a way to better utilize the super resolution results from neighboring frames, trying to achieve real-time performance.
  
      - Proposed to roughly segment the image based on optical flow, and to only run super resolution methods on areas that change much.
