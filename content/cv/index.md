## Education
- *2022-Present* &#160; Ph.D in Electrical and Computer Engineering, the University of Texas at Austin

- *2018-2022* &#8195;&#8194;&#160;  B.E. in Electronic Information Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China
  
## Research Experience
- *2022.9 - present* &#160;**The University of Texas at Austin**
  - Graduate research assistant, advised by Prof. Atlas Wang.
- *2021.7 - 2022.6* &#8195;**The University of Texas at Austin**
  - Remote research intern, advised by Prof. Atlas Wang.
  - Found that clean image features and trigger features are different in terms of their activation distribution in channels, as well as their sensitivity to channel re-ordering. 
  - Proposed an effective approach with minimal overhead based on channel shuffling to help users detect backdoor attacks without the access to clean samples, nor the need to retrain models. 
- *2020.5 - 2021.5* &#160;&#8195;**University of Science and Technology of China**
  - Undergraduate research assistant, advised by Prof. Dong Liu.
  - Formulated a way to better utilize the super resolution results from neighboring frames, trying to achieve real-time performance.
  - Proposed to roughly segment the image based on optical flow, and to only run super resolution methods on areas that change much.
